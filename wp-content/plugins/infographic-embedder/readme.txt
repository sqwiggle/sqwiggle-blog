Give your readers an easier way to embed your infographics (or other images) on their sites, with proper attribution back to you.

== Description ==

With a single URL in an 'Edit Post' page (and no setup), you can automatically add a properly attributed, easy-to-copy embed code to the bottom of your posts. Readers can also edit the width of the image in the embed code to either percent or pixels (the default is 100%).

While it was built with infographics in mind, you can certainly use any image you'd like.
